# Algorithms Webpage

This project is a comprehensive resource for understanding various algorithms, including searching, sorting, and graph algorithms. Each algorithm is presented in its own dedicated HTML page, providing detailed explanations, implementations, and complexity analyses.

## Algorithms Covered

1. **Linear Search**: A simple search algorithm that checks each element in a list sequentially until the desired element is found.
2. **Binary Search**: An efficient search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
3. **Selection Sort**: A sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted and an unsorted part, and repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part to add to the sorted part.
4. **Insertion Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time, with the advantage of being efficient for small data sets.
5. **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array by recursively dividing it into halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves.
6. **Quicksort**: A highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort elements by selecting a 'pivot' and partitioning the array around it.
7. **Counting Sort**: A non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that counts the occurrences of each unique element and uses this information to place elements in their correct position.
8. **Radix Sort**: A non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts numbers by processing individual digits, starting from the least significant digit to the most significant.
9. **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**: An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.
10. **The Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: An algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph, capable of handling graphs with negative weight edges.
11. **The Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: An algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but with no negative cycles).
12. **Huffman Codes**: An algorithm used for lossless data compression, which assigns variable-length codes to input characters based on their frequencies.
13. **LZW Compression**: A dictionary-based compression algorithm that replaces repeated occurrences of data with references to a dictionary.
